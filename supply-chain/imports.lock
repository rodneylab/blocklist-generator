This audit has been reviewed in https://crrev.com/c/5811890

The crate is fairly easy to read thanks to its small size and rich comments.

I've grepped for `-i cipher`, `-i crypto`, `\bfs\b`, `\bnet\b`, and
`\bunsafe\b`.  There were no hits (except for a comment in `README.md`
and `lib.rs` pointing out "Zero `unsafe`").
